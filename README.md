### App Idea Evaluation
// TODO: Evaluate app across the following categories using the App Evaluation Protocol.

- Mobile: Mobile is essential for the instant logging of student behavior. Students use the app to stay up to date on nerby deals, events and spending habits.

- Story: This mobile app will make college life easier and since we are college students-most of our friends and peers are college students as well. Hence, the reaction we would get from our peers would be a positive response.

- Market: College Students

- Habit: This app is meant to be used by college students on a daily basis because it has functunalities like: Chores time-where roomates can use to communicate their responsiblities; job/internship postings- where students will get update on opportunities out there for them; shopping with local deals and so much more. All those functunalites are important in the day-to-day life of a college student.

- Scope: Most of the functions have already been created, the most challenging part of this app might be alert notifications of local events and or deals. We have solid ideas to start off with these app.
