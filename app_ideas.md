## New App Ideas - Evaluate and Categorize

<h1>College Life
</h1>

 - **Description**: Allows students to keep track of expanses, loacal deals and community events, ride share, book sale/rent/give away.

  - **Category:** College lifestyle Networking
   
  - **Mobile:** Mobile is essential for the instant logging of student behavior. Students use the app to stay up to date on nerby deals, events and spending habits.
      
- **Story:** This mobile app will make college life easier and since we are college students-most of our friends and peers are college students as well. Hence, the reaction we would get from our peers would be a positive response.
 

- **Market:** College Students
      
- **Habit:** This app is meant to be used by college students on a daily basis because it has functunalities like: Chores time-where roomates can use to communicate their responsiblities; job/internship postings- where students will get update on opportunities out there for them;  shopping with local deals and so much more. All those functunalites are important in the day-to-day life of a college student. 
      
- **Scope:** Most of the functions have already been created, the most challenging part of this app might be alert notifications of local events and or deals. We have solid ideas to start off with these app. 


<h1>Budget Tracker
</h1>

 - **Description**: Keeps track of the users expenditures so that the user will be able to analyze their expenses and budget accordingly. People don't have to save their reciept anymore they can just scan the barcodes or take a picture of their reciept which can be uploaded to the app to be stored in t

  - **Category:** Finance 

  - **Mobile:** Mobile is essential to add expense inputs or scan the barcode/take a picture of the reciept.
      
- **Story:** This app would make life so easy by helping people track their expenses.
 

- **Market:** Everyone-Buisness owners(can use it to track how their business is doing) and anyone interested in financing their day-to-day life efficently.
      
- **Habit:** It is used whenever people are paying for anything.
      
- **Scope:** It would be amazing if all the recipts would have a qr codes or barcodes so that the user would be able to scan it. To be able to do this would require alot of resources, especially changing the set up of recipt machines. But the other functionalities like getting the user input or taking a pic will be, hopefully, basic.



<h1>Macro Food Tracker
</h1>

 - **Description**: Allows users to take a photo of there food, from there the app will tell you how much protein, carbs and fats are in the meal

  - **Category:** Healthy lifestyle 
 
  - **Mobile:** Mobile is essential for the instant logging of meals
      
- **Story:** This app will make it easier to keep track of food and macros.
 

- **Market:** People who are trying to live healthy
      
- **Habit:** This app is meant to be used by whenever you eat.
      
- **Scope:** I dont think anything like these has ben attempted, I think iphone came out with an API that can measure things with the camera phone. The next step would be generating a database of food. Addition versions will allow users to add to the database.
